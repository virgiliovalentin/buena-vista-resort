## Buena Vista Resort
Final project of my Software Development VIII class, taken in 2019.

This is a basic desktop program made with VB.Net using Windows Forms, as a basic management system for a fictional resort in Panama. 
We made a database connection to a SQL database made in Microsoft SQL Server and show the queries via DataSets in Forms.
